Description: Build two 3D models of a vertebrate from its silhouettes, in a trial to bracket the true body volume and surface area between those of the two models. The models have superelliptical cross-sections, and the two differ from each other in superelliptical exponents. See Motani (2001) for details. Motani, R.
